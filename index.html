            First of all , I want you to understand that coding is not easy. The toughest part is to code daily.
            I belong to a family in which no one understand much about computers.
            I am the first who is doing Computer Science annd Engg.
            Before a year ago, I didn't knew the basics of any of the language. My journey began at that time when
            everyone was into this things.<br>
            All my classmates still know a way lot of things and languages than me.
            So, let me tell you my journey from very zero level.

          I first wrote my first code at the time of lockdown. I was in "Second year". I know, I was too late to start.<br>
        "C++" was in my <b>Second Semester</b> but that semester was compleated online, that was the time when there was complete lockdown. No exams where taken and I am a sleepy head. I had no interest in coding.</div>
        <div class="body-items">
           Then , after six months from that I watched some videos on <b>Youtube</b> . I got inspired and started then and there.
        And my coding journey stared from there.</div>
