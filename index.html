            First of all , I want you to understand that coding is not easy. The toughest part is to code daily.
            I belong to a family in which no one understand much about computers.
            I am the first who is doing Computer Science annd Engg.
            Before a year ago, I didn't knew the basics of any of the language. My journey began at that time when
            everyone was into this things.<br>
            All my classmates still know a way lot of things and languages than me.
            So, let me tell you my journey from very zero level.

                I first wrote my first code at the time of lockdown. I was in "Second year". I know, I was too late to
                start.<br>
                "C++" was in my <b>Second Semester</b> but that semester was compleated online, that was the time when
                there
                was complete lockdown. No exams where taken and I am a sleepy head. I had no interest in coding.</p>

                Then , after six months , my life got totally miserable.
                A friend came to show a hope for me , motivate me to do something rather than just giving up. <br>
                He told me about various stuffs related to fields that I can go ahead with.
                <b> To be very honest : I would had never ever thought of taking a chance into Web dev if he wouldn't
                    pushed
                    me. He was the one who told me about neog.camp</b><br>
                After getting to know about it , I started with first live lesson to another and it never ended. It
                feels
                like I got what I wanted the most.

            I got impressed by the way <b>Tanay Sir</b> teaches. I had completed all the exercises in the mean time but
            unfortunately, I didn't make a way to the first batch of the bootcamp because my exams where in Feb- March
            2021 , So , I had to study for the semesters.<br>
            But I won't miss a second chance , I will make this time count.
        </p>

            <p>
            During the time gap , I watched enough of the videos related to it and practised it. I also liked some of the Youtube channels name <b>"Code with Harry " , "FreeCodeCamp" </b> etc. I got various certifications too, now I am totally into Web Development. And I am all ready for the 2022 batch <b>neogcamp</b> batch.</p>
